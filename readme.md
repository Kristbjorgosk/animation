# Animation with CSS and JS

#### The header has a text that will get bigger and smaller and has a smooth transition

---

#### With the help of Javascript I created a new hover cursor for the buttons, I saw a hover cursor like this on one webpage few days ago and thought it was super cool so I am glad I know how ta create it now!

---

#### The ball was the most challenging part, specially to get it to roll smoothly but in the end I finally got it to work just fine, when the animation is 50% the ball will rotate 360 deg and it will constantly be changing colors. It has a delay as well, so the ball will start moving after 5sec.

#### This website is just a mix of this and that I was trying out so it is more of a "glossery" style rather then a realistic website and you can find comments where needed in the files. I hope you dont get dizzy looking at the live version! :)
